Welcome to this program!
This program will use the 5-question quiz from the Chapter 7 assignment, and restructure the code to employ three functions (since there are hints): askQuestion(), askHint() and printFinalScore()

Chapter 7 Assignment Intro:
This program will ask five questions and keep score of the number of correct answers that you enter, and then display your score at the end of the program.
The topic of this quiz will be Formula One and will be all multiple choice, where you enter a, b, c, etc.
The program will also ask you if you want a hint, but this will mean you get half a point instead of 1 onto your score!

Goodluck and have fun!
