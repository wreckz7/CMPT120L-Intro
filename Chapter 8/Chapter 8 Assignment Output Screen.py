Welcome to this program!
This program will modify the Chapter 7 assignment to continue asking the same quiz question until the user guesses the correct answer or types 'skip'.
If the user guesses correctly, the program will say 'correct', otherwise an incorrect message will print 'sorry, try again' and when 'skip' is typed by the user, the program will print the correct answer and move on.
The user will also be notified of their attempts per question and be given a warning to perhaps skip when they have answered the current question twice.
At the end of the program the user can choose to play again or not and the program will also give the user their average attempts over all 5 questions, as each question in the quiz will be multiple choice with 4 answer choices.

The topic of this quiz will be Formula One and this time there will be no hints.
Goodluck and have fun!
