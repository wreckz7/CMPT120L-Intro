In the world of Fakemon, there is a region known as Astaria, which is home to a diverse range of species and trainers. This region is known to attract trainers from all over the world with its abundance of resources for expert training of these species, known as Fakemon. The region has rugged terrain with mountains and forests for the Fakemon to receive adequate training in their skills, and it houses growing cities in this new world of Fakemon.

However, the region has advanced so much that a group of trainers known as Team Dauntless, who are some of the best trainers in the world, have claimed the region for themselves when it comes to harnessing the power of the legendary Fakemon within the region and ruling with an iron fist. The Astarian government has been unable to stop them, so it's up to a new generation of Fakemon trainers to take up the challenge and put an end to Team Dauntless's evil plans.

As a young trainer, you set out on a journey across Astaria, battling other trainers to improve your skills. Along the way, you'll encounter members of Team Dauntless and their minions, who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. You'll need to use all of your wits, skills, and the power of your developed Fakemon to overcome them and save the region from their tyranny.

Are you ready to defend the region of Astaria from the doings of Team Dauntless? Please type y/yes or n/no to continue: n
Maybe you will be ready another time!

Game Rules:
You are only allowed to have your 3 starter Fakemon (catching to be added)! And your Fakemon can be the same Fakemon as it is all random!
If a Fakemon dies, you will continue with the other Fakemon you have and if you run out of Fakemon before you reach the end, you will have lost!
If all your Fakemon live till the last battle (against the Leader of Team Dauntless) then you win!
After battling any trainer or any Fakemon, you will be given a random amount of xp (the higher the xp, the closer you get to leveling up your player).
You will level up at xp amounts of 250 (level 2), 1000 (level 3), 1600 (level 4) , 2100 (level 5), 2600 (level 6), 3200 (level 7), 3800 (level 8), 4400 (level 9), and 5000 (level 10).
Each move has a randomly generated damage. However, your opponents can use any move from any skillset!
You will be able to recieve one more move per Fakemon as your trainer level progresses to level 3, but for the time being lets give your new starter team some starter moves.

As you traverse through the treacherous mountains of the Astaria region, you stumble upon a mysterious cave. As you enter, you are greeted by a deafening roar that echoes through the cavern. Suddenly, the cave is illuminated by a bright light, revealing a massive figure standing before you. It's none other than the legendary Fokémon, Fakesaurus Rex! With a thunderous stomp, Fakesaurus Rex steps forward, ready to engage in an epic battle. And behind Fakesaurus Rex stands the leader of Team Dauntless, Dylan Huggies. You know that this battle will be no easy feat, but you are determined to prove your worth as a Trainer. You take a deep breath, steeling yourself for what's to come. It's time to show Fakesaurus Rex and Dylan what you and your Fakémon are made of
However, a sudden shift in the air alerts you to the presence of another powerful Fakémon. You turn to see a legendary Fakemon, the mighty Formidsax, standing before you. Formidsax unleashes a powerful roar, ready to join the battle at a moment's notice and on your side against Dylan and Fakesaurus Rex. You also sense a newfound determination to succeed with Formidsax. With your trusted new Fakemon by your side and a fierce determination in your heart, you steel yourself for the fight to come. As Fakesaurus Rex readies itself for battle, you take a deep breath and prepare for what promises to be an epic showdown. Will you emerge victorious and prove yourself as a true master of Fakémon battles and take back the region of Astaria from Dylan, or will Fakesaurus Rex prove too much for you to handle? Only time will tell as the battle begins.

This will be the all or nothing showdown between:
Awais and Dylan Huggies
Formidsax and Fakesaurus Rex
Since both of these Fakemon are legendary, they will have random moves from all the 6 skillsets with different random damage numbers!

In the world of Fakemon, there is a region known as Astaria, which is home to a diverse range of species and trainers. This region is known to attract trainers from all over the world with its abundance of resources for expert training of these species, known as Fakemon. The region has rugged terrain with mountains and forests for the Fakemon to receive adequate training in their skills, and it houses growing cities in this new world of Fakemon.

However, the region has advanced so much that a group of trainers known as Team Dauntless, who are some of the best trainers in the world, have claimed the region for themselves when it comes to harnessing the power of the legendary Fakemon within the region and ruling with an iron fist. The Astarian government has been unable to stop them, so it's up to a new generation of Fakemon trainers to take up the challenge and put an end to Team Dauntless's evil plans.

As a young trainer, you set out on a journey across Astaria, battling other trainers to improve your skills. Along the way, you'll encounter members of Team Dauntless and their minions, who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. You'll need to use all of your wits, skills, and the power of your developed Fakemon to overcome them and save the region from their tyranny.
