Welcome to this program! This program will create a dice game where you will play till you reach a score of 50 or till you lose all 3 of your lives.

The rules on each role are:
If you roll an even number, then you will recieve the value of the roll doubled in points (Ex. a role of 2 will earn 2 x 2 or 4 points)
If you roll an odd number, then you will get the actual value of the dice or roll.
Lastly, if you roll a 6, you will lose 1 of your 3 lives.

Goodluck and Have Fun!
